# MingGong.README ( 4 minute read )

I’m Ming Gong. 

Smarter people than me started creating these README documents to help codify their working principles and accelerate the health and value of their working relationships. 

Many of these ideas may not be original but this is my README. 
 
 
## My Philosophy
I believe in listening.

I believe the best programming language is the English language.

I strive to contribute to an environment of trust, transparency, and idea diversity. I believe by debating our ideas, from our unique perspectives, we can create solutions far richer than any individual’s genius. 

Disagreements should yield action.

I believe in autonomy. It makes people happier, more collegial and inspired. 

I prefer to focus on the greater goal versus personal brand. I prefer to work with people who feel the same way. 

I’d prefer to solve the problem as opposed to being right.


## My Role
As Product Manager I expect to be measured by the success of the product and the ecosystem around it ( “whole product” ).  That may include increasing revenue, bookings, client / user satisfaction and team engagement.  In simpler terms, I am responsible for making things better.   

I view the PM as the quarterback of the product.  PM’s do not own the stadium, draft the team, or pay anyone’s salary.  But PM’s are tasked with understanding the field ( market / competition ), influencing, understanding, and executing the playbook ( strategy / tactics / features ) and giving the ball to the runnings back / wide receivers ( sales / marketing / engineering / services ) to score touchdowns ( new clients / features / value ).   If you do so the score will take care of itself  
 
I see the team and the playbook as the “whole product”.  I expect to cut across all functional areas of the business to succeed.  When I see large or small problems anywhere in the product, I like to fix it with the help of the entire business. I want to do the right thing and will constantly ask things like “Why are we doing this and why now?” /  “Does this help us win new business?” /  “Does this help us scale or increase our margins?”  / “Does this make life better for our users?”
 
## My 3 responsibilities: 
1. Vision:  I am responsible for formulating and evangelizing the relevant problems to be solved and the unique solution by which the company will win the market.  E.g. 2-5 year strategy / tactics.
2. Design:  I am responsible for delivering the right features + services to provide value.  I do this by partnering closely with internal and external stakeholders.  E.g. roadmap / shipping / go-to-market
3. Execution:  I am responsible for doing whatever it takes to ensure we ship a high quality solution as fast as we can.  This involves streamlining the ways in which we work, breaking through barriers and filling in the gaps when needed.   This includes getting coffee, triaging bugs, and *  e.g. agile rituals, quick decisions, removing obstacles
 
## My 3 senses:
I’ve had the privilege of working as a software practitioner across of variety of business verticals and geos with some of the world’s most well known companies.  In that time, I’d like to believe I have strongly developed the following:  

1. Product Sense:  The ability to usually make correct product decisions even in the presence of major ambiguity through user empathy, creativity and domain knowledge. 
2. Execution Sense:  The ability to align people towards a particular objective and orchestrate the completion of complex projects by exercising persuasiveness, drive, and “scrappy-ness” in addition to strong organizational abilities.  
3. Analytical Sense:  The ability to frame the right questions, evaluate multiple facets of a problem, derive solutions, and simulate possible outcomes based on available data and anecdotes. 
 
## My communication style:  
I prefer the following hierarchy of communication:  Face to Face > Video Conference > Slack/Hipchat > Email 

My favorite environment is sitting with a team, discussing and sharing what we’re doing, arguing about the real problem and attacking it through a combination of software, people and process.


I’m not a big fan of emails, especially “ping-pong” email chains. I prefer things with URLs ( e.g. Google docs / Dropbox ). If I do use email, I try to make it quick with easy requests.   If I need someone’s attention on something with a high level of urgency, I won’t be expecting someone to find that out by checking their email.

## My preferred rituals: 
I believe regular stand ups and demos are great for keeping the product moving forward.  I believe standups are effective when the focus is on the baton and not the runners.  The stories should do the talking.  In an ideal environment, all core contributors of the product are in the standup.  

Demos are not only for showing off shiny UX.  It’s valuable to see the new API in Postman or the new piece of sales collateral.  I believe demos are the best way to drive progress, collaborate, celebrate, socialize and pressure test solutions to problems at any level  in any part of the product.
 
## My schedule:    
I’m usually up by 4am to lift heavy things in my garage. I do this so that by the time my daughters wake up I can look like a model citizen and a champion against gravity. 

I am usually not reachable after 8pm, but if something is urgent and important, I hope I am notified via SMS so I can help. 

My calendar might look full, but if you need to talk to me, crash my calendar and I will try and make time for you. 

I necessarily reserve time for deep work to focus. In our industry and in this age, instant communication is an expectation, but context switching incurs real costs to quality of work. Let me know if you know another way to increase the quality of your work.


## My random facts: 
I was born in a cold desert in China. Almost 20 years later I was attacked by a bear in Colorado. I have trained in martial arts with a high level of discipline, over a long period of time. But that's not why I live to tell the tale.
